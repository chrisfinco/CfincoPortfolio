# CfincoPortfolio


The requirements of this project were that the program allowed the user to select from a list of course names and register for the selected course.
The program should display all courses the user is currently registered for, and should display an error if the user tries to register for
an already selected course. The program should also keep track of how many credits the user has registered for, and display an error if they
try to register for more than 9 credits, which is 3 courses.
One main difference in the design of the console and wpf designs is the inclusion of the dropdown list to select classes from in the wpf
version. Because the user has a limited amount of choices of which courses they can register for, the program doesn't have to check if
the user tries to register for a non-existent course like the console application does.
To make debugging easier, I made sure to only make one change to my code at a time, and ran the code to check my work in case the change
caused any errors.
